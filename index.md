You wake up in your student accommodation and look outside to realise your campus has been turned into a maze. Make it out of the maze and to the bus to escape campus!
- Find your bus ticket to escape the university!
- Escape from the evil dean, before he sends you back to your dorm!
- Gather sweet treats located around the maze!
